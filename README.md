# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

# 页面启动

```shell
yarn
yarn start
```
>合约部署在goerli测试网，可以自行查看contracts文件夹
>前端页面采用React+chakra UI，合约使用solidity+hardhat
